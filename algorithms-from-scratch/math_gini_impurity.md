## Gini Impurity: A Summary

Gini impurity is a measure of the impurity or diversity of a dataset. It quantifies the likelihood of a randomly chosen element being misclassified if it was randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the dataset. Gini impurity is widely used in decision trees to evaluate the quality of splits.

## Mathematical Definition

For a dataset with $n$ classes, the Gini impurity is defined as:

$$
\text{Gini} = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2
$$

where $p_i$ is the proportion of elements belonging to class $i$ in the dataset.

The value of Gini impurity ranges from 0 (perfect purity, where all elements belong to a single class) to a maximum of $\frac{n-1}{n}$ (maximum impurity, where elements are evenly distributed across all classes).

## Mathematical Derivation

Let's derive the Gini impurity formula step by step.

#### Step 1: Probability of Incorrect Classification

Consider a set $S$ with $n$ elements, where the elements belong to $k$ different classes. Let $p_i$ be the probability of an element belonging to class $i$. The probability that a randomly chosen element from the set is correctly classified (i.e., it belongs to its own class) is $p_i$.

The probability that it is incorrectly classified (i.e., it is not classified into class $i$) is $1 - p_i$.

#### Step 2: Expected Value of Incorrect Classification

The Gini impurity can be thought of as the expected value of incorrectly classifying an element, given the probability distribution of the classes.

For a set $S$ with elements from $k$ classes, the probability of picking an element of class $i$ and misclassifying it (i.e., it being classified as not class $i$) is $p_i \cdot (1 - p_i)$.

Summing over all classes, we get the total expected probability of misclassification:

$$\sum_{i=1}^k p_i \cdot (1 - p_i)$$

#### Step 3: Simplify the Expression

We can simplify the above expression:

$$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{i=1}^k p_i \cdot (1 - p_i) &= \sum_{i=1}^k (p_i - p_i^2) \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^k p_i - \sum_{i=1}^k p_i^2
\end{aligned}$$

#### Step 4: Sum of Probabilities

By the definition of probabilities, the sum of the probabilities of all classes is 1:

$$\sum_{i=1}^k p_i = 1$$

Thus, we can substitute 1 for $\sum_{i=1}^k p_i$:

$$1 - \sum_{i=1}^k p_i^2$$

#### Step 5: Final Gini Impurity Formula

The final formula for the Gini impurity is therefore:

$$G(S) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^k p_i^2$$

This shows that the Gini impurity is $1$ minus the sum of the squared probabilities of each class.



## Examples

1. **Single Class (Pure Node):**
   - Consider a dataset where all elements belong to the same class (e.g., class 0).
   - The proportion for class 0, $p_0$, is 1.
   - Gini impurity: $\text{Gini} = 1 - (1^2) = 1 - 1 = 0$.

2. **Two Classes with Equal Distribution:**
   - Consider a dataset with two classes (0 and 1), each having 50% of the elements.
   - The proportions are $p_0 = 0.5$ and $p_1 = 0.5$.
   - Gini impurity: $\text{Gini} = 1 - (0.5^2 + 0.5^2) = 1 - (0.25 + 0.25) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.

3. **Two Classes with Unequal Distribution:**
   - Consider a dataset with 70% elements in class 0 and 30% in class 1.
   - The proportions are $p_0 = 0.7$ and $p_1 = 0.3$.
   - Gini impurity: $\text{Gini} = 1 - (0.7^2 + 0.3^2) = 1 - (0.49 + 0.09) = 1 - 0.58 = 0.42$.

## Application in Decision Trees

In decision trees, Gini impurity is used to evaluate potential splits. The goal is to choose the split that results in the lowest Gini impurity in the resulting child nodes, thus creating the most homogeneous groups.

**Example Split Evaluation:**

- **Initial Node:** Suppose we have a node with an equal number of elements from two classes (0 and 1). The initial Gini impurity is 0.5.
- **Possible Split:** If a split results in one child node having 90% of elements from class 0 and the other child node having 80% of elements from class 1, the Gini impurities of the child nodes will be lower, resulting in a reduction in overall impurity.

By iteratively choosing splits that reduce Gini impurity, the decision tree creates nodes that are increasingly homogeneous, leading to a model that can accurately classify new data.
