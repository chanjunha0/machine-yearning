# 24 Hour Projects

## Overview

Welcome to the **24 Hour Projects** repository! This repository is dedicated to housing various projects that I complete by following quick tutorials available online. 

**The primary objective is to learn new concepts and skills rapidly, with each project being strictly limited to a maximum duration of 24 hours.**

The idea behind this approach is to focus on **grasping the core concepts** and getting hands-on experience with new technologies, frameworks, or methodologies without getting bogged down in details. 

This helps in building a broad base of knowledge quickly and effectively.
