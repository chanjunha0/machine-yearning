# Cryptography

Welcome to the Cryptography repository! This repository logs my explorations, curiosity, and learnings in the domain of cryptography. Here, you will find various cryptographic algorithms and ciphers that I have studied, along with detailed explanations and implementations.

## Summary Table of Explored Algorithms and Ciphers

| Name            | Cipher Family | Logic          | Description                                                      | Method                        |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Caesar Cipher   | Symmetric     | Substitution   | A basic substitution cipher for encryption.                       | Shift by n characters         |
| Atbash Cipher   | Symmetric     | Substitution   | A substitution cipher that maps each letter to its reverse.       | Map each letter to its reverse|
| ROT13 Cipher    | Symmetric     | Substitution   | A special case of the Caesar cipher, replacing each letter with the letter 13 positions after it. | Shift by 13 characters        |
| Jefferson Disk  | Symmetric     | Substitution   | Uses a set of rotating disks, each with a scrambled alphabet, to encrypt and decrypt messages. | Align disks and read off different rows |
