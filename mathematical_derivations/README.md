# Mathematical Derivations

Welcome to the **Mathematical Derivations** repository. This repository contains detailed explanations and step-by-step derivations of important mathematical formulas and metrics used in machine learning and data science.

### Sigmoid Function
- **Description**: The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that produces an "S"-shaped curve, often used in neural networks and logistic regression.
- **Formula**:
  
  $$
  \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
  $$


### Precision
- **Description**: Precision is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of positive predictions made by a classification model.
- **Formula**:
  
  $$
  \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
  $$


### Recall
- **Description**: Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model.
- **Formula**:
  
  $$
  \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
  $$


### F1 Score
- **Description**: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single measure that balances both metrics.
- **Formula**:
  
  $$
  F1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
  $$
