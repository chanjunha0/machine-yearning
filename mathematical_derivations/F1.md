## Why is the F1 Score Formula the Way It Is?

The F1 score formula is designed to provide a single metric that balances both precision and recall. It uses the harmonic mean rather than the arithmetic mean to ensure that both precision and recall are given equal importance, and to penalize extreme values more than the arithmetic mean would.

### Balancing Precision and Recall

1. **Precision** measures the accuracy of the positive predictions:
   $$
   \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
   $$

2. **Recall** measures the ability to find all relevant cases:
   $$
   \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
   $$

### Harmonic Mean

- The harmonic mean is used because it is more sensitive to low values. If either precision or recall is low, the harmonic mean will be low.
- The harmonic mean of two numbers $a$ and $b$ is given by:
  $$
  H = \frac{2ab}{a + b}
  $$
- When applied to precision and recall, the F1 score is:
  $$
  F1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
  $$

### Worked Example

Consider the following confusion matrix:

|                | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Actual Positive** | TP = 50            | FN = 10            |
| **Actual Negative** | FP = 5             | TN = 35            |

1. **Calculate Precision and Recall**:
   $$
   \text{Precision} = \frac{50}{50 + 5} = \frac{50}{55} \approx 0.909
   $$
   $$
   \text{Recall} = \frac{50}{50 + 10} = \frac{50}{60} \approx 0.833
   $$

2. **Calculate F1 Score**:
   $$
   F1 = 2 \times \frac{0.909 \times 0.833}{0.909 + 0.833} = 2 \times \frac{0.757797}{1.742} \approx 0.870
   $$

### Interpretation

- The F1 score combines precision and recall into a single metric, ensuring that the model performs well on both metrics.
- If either precision or recall is very low, the F1 score will also be low, highlighting the modelâ€™s poor performance in that aspect.

## Why Use the Harmonic Mean for F1 Score?

### Sensitivity to Imbalance
The harmonic mean is more sensitive to low values compared to the arithmetic mean. If either precision or recall is very low, the harmonic mean will be low. This ensures that both precision and recall are reasonably high for a good F1 score.

### Balancing Act
When you average precision and recall using the arithmetic mean, the result can be misleading if one value is much higher than the other. The harmonic mean addresses this by emphasizing the smaller value, ensuring that both metrics need to be reasonably high to achieve a high F1 score.

### Penalizing Extremes
In situations where you want to avoid the extremes (very high precision and very low recall, or vice versa), the harmonic mean is effective. It ensures that improving one metric at the cost of the other doesn't lead to an overall high score, which could be misleading.

### Example: Arithmetic Mean vs. Harmonic Mean

Consider an example where precision and recall are quite different:
- **Precision**: 0.9 (90%)
- **Recall**: 0.1 (10%)

#### Arithmetic Mean
The arithmetic mean of precision and recall is:
$ \text{Arithmetic Mean} = \frac{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}{2} = \frac{0.9 + 0.1}{2} = \frac{1.0}{2} = 0.5 $

This result suggests a moderate performance, which might be misleading because recall is actually very poor.

#### Harmonic Mean (F1 Score)
The harmonic mean (F1 score) of precision and recall is:
$ F1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} = 2 \times \frac{0.9 \times 0.1}{0.9 + 0.1} = 2 \times \frac{0.09}{1.0} = 0.18 $

This result correctly reflects the poor recall, showing a much lower score, indicating that there is a significant issue with recall that needs to be addressed.

### Conclusion
The harmonic mean is preferred over the arithmetic mean in the context of the F1 score because:
- It provides a balanced measure that doesn't allow a high value in one metric (precision or recall) to compensate for a low value in the other.
- It ensures that both precision and recall need to be high for a high F1 score.
- It avoids the misleading moderate performance that the arithmetic mean might suggest when there is a significant imbalance between precision and recall.
