## Detailed Project Descriptions

### How does changes in Fuel Prices influence Public Train Ridership in Singapore?
- Investigate if fluctuations in fuel prices affect public train ridership in Singapore.
- EDA on data from Land Transport Authority's Datamall API and Singstat.gov.
- Generate a model to understand current usage patterns and serve as a forecasting tool for transport operators.
- Potentially guide future infrastructure developments and service enhancements.

### Is it possible to optimize a Tesco Store's inventory by modeling the relationship between property type and buying behaviors of its residents?
- Analyze Tesco grocery data and Londonâ€™s property data to identify patterns and trends.
- Use machine learning techniques to predict food categories purchased based on property distribution.
- Test feasibility of developing a model for inventory optimization based on district property types.

### What is the Best Chess Opening?
- EDA on Kaggle chess dataset to find the opening with the highest win-rate.

### Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
- Create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
