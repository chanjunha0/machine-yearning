## Projects Portfolio

This repository contains my ML projects, showcasing my work and learning journey in the field of machine learning. Each project is organized in its own subfolder. Below is an overview of the projects I have completed, including key details such as the project name, algorithms used, completion date, and more.

| Project Type | Title | Description | Methods | Algorithms Used | Status | Completion Date | Key Achievements |
|--------------|-------|-------------|---------|-----------------|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| School (Group)       | How does changes in Fuel Prices influence Public Train Ridership in Singapore? | The projects seeks to investigate if fluctuations in fuel prices affects public train ridership in Singapore. EDA was conduted on data on public train usage and fuel prices from Land Transport Authority's Datamall API and Singstat.gov. The goal is to generate a model that not only aids in understanding current usage patterns but also serves as a strategic forecasting tool for transport operators such as SMRT Corporation in Singapore, potentially guiding future infrastructure developments and service enhancements. | EDA, End-to-end ML pipeline | Time Series Decomposition, Random Forest  | Completed | Apr 2024 | Grade: A |
| School       | Is it possible to optimize a Tesco Store's inventory by modeling the relationship between property type and buying behaviors of its residents? | The project involves analyzing Tesco grocery data and Londonâ€™s property data to identify patterns and trends in the data. Machine learning techniques will be used to predict food categories purchased based on the property distribution. The goal is to test the feasibility of developing a model for inventory optimisation based on the district's property types and distribution. | EDA, End-to-end ML pipeline | Multi-label Regression by aggregrating multiple RF models | Completed | March 2024 | Grade: A |
| School       | What is the Best Chess Opening? | EDA on kaggle chess dataset to find the opening with highest win-rate. | EDA | nil | Completed | Feb 2024 | Grade: A |
| Kaggle (Intro) | Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster | Create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. | EDA, End-to-end ML pipeline | SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest | Completed | Jan 2024 | Nil, Practice Notebook |
